	abstract = {In the present paper, the mechanism of droplet formation in immiscible liquid/liquid T-junction system has been studied numerically and analytically. Different droplet stream patterns such as long slugs, small spheres, stable stream connected to a jet and finally parallel flow are observed, which are conventionally called squeezing, dripping and jetting regimes appearing under appropriate numerical setups. We emphasize that the effects of surface force and viscous force in this system alternatively dominate the droplets stream, and the periodically varied pressure and local velocity ensure the generation of uniform droplets. In particular, a two-dimensional lubrication analysis is applied to the confined continuous flow between dispersed emerging phase and the channel wall, which verifies that the pressure buildup upstream facilitate the long slugs formation. The numerical results and theoretical analysis hold a good agreement with the experimental measurements.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the findings from a numerical investigation of the droplet formation process in a T-junction microchannel. A volume-of-fluid (VOF) model that is refined with smoothing operations was used to minimise spurious or non-physical velocities at the micro-scale, in order to obtain more accurate velocity results from the microchannel simulations. The model was validated with experimental results and was able to yield a closer match to the experimental data compared to the standard VOF model. Subsequently the refined VOF model was used to investigate the velocity field evolution during the droplet formation process to further understand the underlying physics. For the squeezing regime, we observed regions of large recirculation after droplet break-up with reversed flows. These recirculation regions were also seen in the transition and dripping regimes but reversed flows did not occur. We also studied the effects of varying the dispersed phase flow rate under a constant capillary number (Ca) of the continuous phase. The results show that increasing the dispersed phase flow increases the droplet length and formation frequency. In addition, the frequency of the velocity fluctuation at the junction vicinity was found to coincide with the rate of new droplet formation. Finally, the effects of Weber number on droplet length was also investigated and it was found that inertial forces significantly influence droplet formation, albeit being the least dominant force.},

The same is true for models, which describe a limited range of the droplet formation spectrum, due to obvious boundary conditions. In this paper, we tried to unify the available data into a more general model using statistical analysis. This approach was chosen because of its accessibility and ease of use for unbiased analysis of available data. We found that data from various literature sources, and therefore different regimes, were described with a two-step model, which distinguishes between a droplet growth and a droplet detachment phase. The two-step model was found statistically valid over the whole range of observed droplet shapes (viz plugs, discs, or drops) and encompassed all systems and sources. Channel dimensions were found to determine droplet growth, while both continuous and disperse phase flow rate govern the subsequent time needed for detachment. By using a statistical approach, we were able to generalise data available on T-junctions into general rules of behaviour.},

Droplets are evaluated based on the size and frequency of generation. Droplet size control is essential for microfluidic lab-on-a-chip applications in biology, chemistry, and medicine. We developed a three-dimensional numerical model that can emulate the performance of the physical system. A numerical model can help design droplet-generation chips with new junction geometries, different dispersed and continuous phase types, and different flow rates. Our model uses a conservative level-set method (LSM) to track the interface between two immiscible fluids using a fixed mesh. Water was used for the dispersed phase and mineral oil for the continuous phase. The effects of the continuous-to-dispersed flow rate ratio (Qo/Qw) and the surfactant concentration on the droplet generation were studied both using the numerical model and experimentally. The numerical model was found to render results that are in good agreement with the experimental ones, which validates the LSM model. The validated numerical model was used to study the time effect of changing Qo/Qw on the generated droplet size. Properly timing when the flow rates are changed enables control over the size of the next generated droplet, which is useful for single-droplet size modulation applications.},

It drastically enhances the advantages of microfluidics in terms of low consumption, automation and high throughput and is widely used in chemical, microelectronics, materials science, biology and biomedical engineering etc. In this paper, an iterative learning control (ILC) scheme is proposed to accurately control the droplet size at low capillary numbers. ILC is able to revise the current control input based on the error information measured during previous experimental operations and ultimately produce the desired droplet size in the T-junction microfluidic channel we design. The feasibility of the ILC scheme is verified through experiments, where two different situations are addressed in detail. The results indicate that only a few number of iterations is required to achieve the desired droplet size. The main characteristics of the proposed ILC scheme are as follow: (1) it does not require an accurate mathematical model of the microfluidic systems, which can resolve the severe uncertainties of complex droplet microfluidic system well. (2) Owing to the feedforward characteristic and simple structure of ILC, it is easier to be implemented in practical experimental environments than typical feedback controllers, e.g., proportional-integral-derivative controller. (3) Compared with the traversal methods widely used in medical and biological fields, the idea of ILC would reduce the number of experimental trials significantly.},
