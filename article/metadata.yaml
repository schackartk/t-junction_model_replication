# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Microfluidic T-junctions are used for creating dispersed bubbles or droplets
of a consistent volume. Such platforms have been used for a variety of applications,
such as chemical microreactors, biological screening assays, and DNA analysis.
It is often critical that the volume of the
bubbles or droplets are consistent and predictable. A mathematical model was
previously developed by van Steijn et al., for predicting the volume of bubbles and droplets formed in
microfluidic T-junctions, however, their code was not made readily available.
In this work, we develop Python modules that implement the mathematical model and 
replicate the figures in the original work. The model
could be fully replicated based solely on the contents of the original article.
However, one figure provided in the original work was inconsistent with the
model equations while another could be replicated but with a small discrepancy."
